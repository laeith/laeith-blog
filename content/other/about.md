This started out as a way to practice my English skills. I usually make an honest attempt at writing something useful, mostly as a source of clarity, discipline and innovation for myself.
It turns out that it's surprisingly hard to present ideas clearly, precisely and concisely, perfecting it is a long, bumpy road.

Hopefully this will help.

Privately I'm a mix of a software engineer, amateur investor, peasant philosopher, literature enthusiast and a few other things. Freedom advocate and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu novice.
Expect the oddest from each. Recently I've been mostly busy learning and exploring various areas of computer science and software engineering, given that I expect the majority of writing to be of technical nature.
