**Engineer wannabe, peasant philosopher and a physics hobbyist.**

My name is Marcin Mazurkiewicz and I grew up in a small town somewhere in the eastern Poland.
I'm one of those strange people with untamed desire for unique challenges (and failing at them, mostly) and learning new stuff.
I am also a vivid reader doing my best to keep my to-read list in check.
Strong advocate for personal freedoms, kinda libertarianish.

I used to do structural engineering for a living, although briefly, nowadays I work primarily as a software developer. I also have an engineering degree but I don't really remember which of my crimes are responsible for that.

If you want to contact me feel free to do so via marcin.mazurkiewicz.ac@gmail.com.

## About blog

What should you expect here? Well, mostly some not-so-advanced notes related to learning, programming and physics but in the future you may expect also posts with 'extra' content. We shall see how it goes.

The blog's purpose is twofold, firstly I hope that making a public 'archive' like this one will help me stay disciplined enough to write something bigger on a little more regular basis.
The blog is also a playground where I can keep honing my English skills. It should also help me stay on track with my personal schedule.
And on top of that if someone finds it useful then that's even better.
