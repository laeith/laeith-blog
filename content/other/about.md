This started out as a way to practice my English writing skills, nowadays I usually make an honest attempt at writing something useful, mostly as a source of clarity and innovation for myself.
Surprisingly, it turns out that it's not so easy to present ideas clearly and precisely - especially in a foreign language.

Hopefully this will help.

Privately I'm a mix of a software engineer, peasant philosopher and an amateur investor. Expect the oddest from each.
