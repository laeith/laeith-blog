## **Open education**

I tend to do a course or two once in a while, because these are usually quite time-demanding I like to write a short review afterwards, for some reason it helps me solidify knowledge and sum up what was done.

For the first time in our history we got a chance to access world-class education anytime, from anywhere, for free - this opportunity is simply way too good to pass up.

#### **Linear algebra**
Well, there aren't that many choices when it comes to learning linear algebra (or as least I haven't found many). Basically, for revision I used LAFF (edx.org) and MIT OCW by Prof. Gilbert Strang.

#### **Nand2Tetris aka Build a Modern Computer from First Principles, Part 1 by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) @ Coursera**
From the beginning of my programming journey I always had that neverending question lurking somewhere in the back of my mind: **How the heck does it really work?** I've started with Python, it's a high level language that is extremely good for being productive while at the same time not beeing that great with actual computer science, and because of that I never had a chance to toy with actual hardware.  

Ratings speak for themselves - it has an average of 4.9 out of 5 based on 450(!) reviews on Coursera. You can watch a short talk about this course by [Shimon Schocken himself on Ted.com](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course).

I have always had a vague idea how it might work and why some things are the way they are but I really lacked hands-on experience with low-level. This course is a real eye opener when it comes to comprehending how computers work. During the course we get a unique opportunity to build a computer for the ground up, in this case it means from defining logic gates in 'almostHDL' up to creating a working assembly-like language and using various input/output simulations in the meantime. All of it works inside a hardware simulator written in Java, which they provide out of the box.  

Obviously modern CPUs are much, much more complicated but the very idea of computer is easily grasped during the course. I have to admit that it has fully satisfied my curiosity, it struck the perfect balance between details and 'the general idea' (ok, maybe some details I have filled on my own during some long googling sessions).  
The 2nd part is supposedly focused much more on programming (some compliers writing etc.) and for the time being I leave it for later.

#### **Algorithms, Part 1 by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (Princeton) @ Coursera**
Algorithms, algorithms, algorithms. Unlike...[TODO]

#### **Introduction to Computer Science by HarvardX @ edx.org**
As name suggests, this is an introductory course aka CS50x. This is basically a recording of live lectures held at Harvard by David Malan. It's a very broad course that tackles many many CS topics, though quite shallowly (I guess that's what one should expect from intro lectures). The quality is superb, I have hard time finding any weak points, although I'm not really sure if it's because it was very good or because I was a little 'bored' during it.

It's just that it looks like I took it way too late, most of the concepts were already well known to me so it was kinda a revision... That I didn't really need at that time. Somewhere in the middle I had an opportunity to work on a nice side project which I eagerly took and never came back to finish it. But like I said, it's a nice introductory to CS (computer science, not really programming).

#### **Advanced Data Structures in Java & Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance by UC San Diego @ Coursera**
These two courses are probably the best way to start one's journey with algorithms that I know about, I remember the tasks being quite fun and engaging - the main idea is to implement a few shortest path algorithms (final ones being A* and Dijkstra's) in different scenarios, one of them was to actually create algorithms that work on real data. They provide a GUI (written in Java) and you continually update it with new functionality each week. You can extract map data of virtually any city using the GUI and if you implement algorithms you can visually see your work - and this (for some reason) seems to be exceptionally rewarding for newbies.

Those are fairly short courses that I would recommend to people with very limited CS knowledge and skills. It also requires some basic Java, but knowing fundamentals should suffice.

The only thing I wasn't impressed with was pace and difficulty level. Anyway It was worth the time.
