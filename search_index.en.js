Sounds great, but one will inevitably face the main problem - where to start?\nTurns out there are many ways to start, fortunately most of them seem to have relatively obvious trade-offs.\nBasic requirements \n\nFom the very start I knew that this must be simple, not only because of my poor web skills but also because I didn't really want to spend much time on the technical side.\nI had only a few requirements that can be summed up as:\n\nLow-effort, mostly works out of the box\nMust be local friendly, I really want to have the content on my disk\nUsable with version control system\nPreferably based on Markdown with basic support for images, syntax highlighting, linking etc.\n\nThere are many options out there, starting from a fully featured, ready-to-use platforms like medium with WYSIWYG interface through static-site generators (SSG) and ending with custom DIY solutions.\nFully featured, hosted solutions - medium.com, dev.to etc. \n\nProbably the most common hosted solution is Medium, there are a few other choices in this category (e.g. Blogger) but they mostly share the same problems. Paradoxically, the main problem with these solutions is that they must somehow make money but running a blogging platform... seems to be a very hard business. Medium launched in 2012 and apparently seven years later they still can't make it even.\nSince publishing is free, and they really have to make at least some money to make the business viable they went after readers, either directly or by gathering data about them.\nThis unfortunately sooner or later leads to questionable decisions, like welcoming readers with such atrocities:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nNot to mention the nagging to download their mobile app, popping social media integrations, almost working RSS.\nOn the upside, theoretically, such platforms should make it easier to promote new blogs, make it easy to reach new audiences.\nThat's probably a lot of value if one wants to commercialize writing. I would also say that the easy of use for publishers is a huge\nbenefit - no hosting, not so much tweaking etc. Especially for non-tech-savvy people sounds like a good deal. \nStatic site generator - Gatsby, Jekyll, Zola, Hugo, Pelican and others \n\nThis is an interesting niche, looks like static site generators exploded during last decade, there are so many that it's even hard to enumerate them. One can probably find an SSG written in every single popular language, sometimes even a few. It's an almost perfect solution for software engineers and tech tinkerers, it's also this type of software that is probably fun to write (probably the reason for huge population).\nStatic site generator is an application that creates raw HTML pages from different templates/components. This is a simple alternative to bigger systems such as Wordpress or Drupal. The sheer beauty of such solutions lies in simplicity (given at least basic programming skills), we download a sample theme, create a few Markdown-based articles and press 'generate'. \nA few milliseconds later we get a directory fully of static webpages ready to be deployed, at least in theory.\nThere are two main distractions faced up-front:\n\nInitial configuration\nDeployment\n\nThere is definitely some cost that needs to be paid up-front, this is especially true for the configuration part. I'd strongly recommend generators that provide single binaries. It makes it trivial to get everything up and running:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nOn top of simplicity we get consistency, I used to toy a little with Python-based solution \"Pelican\", getting it up and running tends to be an irregular experience - installing Python, getting pip, getting dependencies and finally running efforts might vary from very straightforward to a multi-hour battle (Python2 clashes with Python3, pip missing/clashes, incorrect dependencies, setting up virtual environments, trying to build old blogs that didn't have version specified...). With single-binary solution we can put it into a repository and forget about all these problems once and for all.\nUnfortunately the remaining part of configuration is more time-demanding, picking a starting theme, understanding template engine, doing basic modifications and making sure that everything works (images, syntax highlighting, shortcodes, archive) is a few hours effort at the minimum.\nSurprisingly, because the end product we get is a bunch of static files It's trivial to get it up and running in public - the market is big enough to have many quick solutions ready, to name a few: Netlify, GitGub Pages, GitLab Pages... with SSGs having documentation for each major platform - e.g. Zola for GitHub Pages\nFully DYI approach, creating a blog platform from scratch \n\nI believe that unless you're trying to create a feature rich portal with potential of having lots of custom features, at least the size of Art of Manliness you shouldn't even think about it. Even then it's probably better to start with something dirty and quick, only eventually moving to a custom solution.\nSomething that I outright crossed as a no-go. There is no way I would be able to justify time spent on creating a blogging platform from scratch, this sounds like a great idea for a 1st year student that wants to be a front-end developer - and I'm not entirely sure about that either.\nFinal words \n\nHaving evaluated most choices I settled with an SSG - Zola, I'm not sure if it's much better than e.g. Hugo as both provide very polished basic functionality and I don't really have any use for the more advanced ones. Hugo is definitely better when it comes to the number of templates readily available, Zola is a much younger project. Ruby fans should take a closer look at Jekyll and Python professionals might be content with Pelican.\nBecause all of them support Markdown it shouldn't be that hard to switch (assuming simple templates) if something goes wrong.\nThis might not be the best choice for people that 'just want to start blogging, right now', for such people I'd recommend looking into hosted solutions like Medium or Blogger. Yes, they have their problems but sometimes nothing beats ease of use. People, especially programmers tend to underappreciate how much time can be saved with not perfect but perfectly good-enough solutions.\nOn the other hand static site generators seem to be the best choice for novice, tech-savvy bloggers, especially if they don't really want to make money out of it. So far I'm quite pleased with my choice.\n","id":"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-03-03-how-to-create-a-blog/","title":"Do you want to create a blog?"},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-04-04-wire-formats/":{"body":"Every time we want to send data from one system to another over network, or to a file, we have to somehow represent it in bytes, this is achieved by data encoding. It's a translation of in-memory objects to byte sequences and vice versa.\nThis article will present several formats by comparing their performance and considering basic ease of use. Alongside benchmarking the goal is to find a suitable serialization method for my distributed system communication, it should be reasonably fast and must seamlessly integrate between multiple subsystems written in Java, Python and Rust.\nGiven that applications evolve it's reasonable to assume that our communication will evolve as well, on top of it might not be possible to update all systems at once, and we may be forced to do a rolling-update. For such scenarios it's vital to analyze how schema can evolve. Fortunately for me this is considered a second-tier requirement at the moment - but for anyone interested I suggest taking a look at Martin Kleppmann 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications' chapter 4, or his excellent post about it.\nMethodology \n\nI'm going to compare simple scenarios like serialization, deserialization and sometimes special combinations using provided Java clients for each respective format.\nMicro-benchmarking is notoriously tricky to get right, and even when we get it right it's hard to draw correct conclusions. On top of that, I'm using a JVM-based language that makes it even worse. Profiling is a must, even with these simple benchmarks I had to profile the code to weed out quite a few obvious problems.\nIt's turns out it's crucial to use data that is as close to production data as possible, for benchmarking I used a message schema that is fairly representative for my use-case - but schema can make significant difference.\nAdditionally, performance will vary depending not only on how you use the client but also what client is used (i.e. Java Avro client vs C++ Avro client etc.) \nNote that the purpose of this benchmark is to compare serialization/deserialization speed, this means that these values probably don't represent 'optimal' speed that could be achieved - there are potential optimizations that could be applied like: avoid autoboxing, using alternative client/approach, using more judicious types (do we really need an int for a version field?) etc.\nUnfortunately it means that this might be unfair for some formats, especially those that allow for more fine-grained control.\nOn the other hand, it's probably better to measure the most likely usage instead of trying to hyper-tune everything - to see where hyper optimization may lead, see Benchmarks Game source codes. I tried my best to balance fairness with 'typical usage'.\nLast but not least, the code for these benchmarks is available here. Improvement suggestions highly appreciated.\nProtobuf schema:\nmessage PingPong {\n  int64 id = 1;                 // 1\n  int32 version = 2;            // 2\n  string message = 3;           // \"Random message - \" + System.currentTimeMillis()\n  bool is_important = 4;        // true\n  repeated string names = 5;    // [\"John-1\", \"John-1\", \"John-2\"]\n  repeated int32 ints = 6;      // [1, 22, 333, 4444, 55555]\n  repeated double doubles = 7;  // [1.132314, 2.111111, 3.314155, 4.1231488, 5.12395832]\n}\n\nOther formats have equivalent/similar schemas, for details see code.\nBenchmarks \n\nLet's cut to the chase, on my desktop (Ryzen 3900x): throughput - more is better, ± stands for confidence interval (at 99.9%):\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nTabular:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThere are a few surprises, the first one is relatively poor performance for the default Avro client usage, results are almost on par with typical JSON read/write speed. I definitely expected better.\nFor Avro serialization I also provide slightly more optimized version while I'm not doing the same for deserialization. For a typical user I consider it to be a little too error-prone to operate on a single mutable object/ByteBuffer post deserialization, especially when it's not advised as 'the standard approach'. Eventually, it can perform quite well during serialization, see 'Why benchmarking is tricky part 1' below for details.\nThe format itself is only partially responsible for speed, it sets a theoretical upper limit. Typical JSON serialization as done in Jackson (via reflection) has very polished user experience but performs rather poorly. Surprisingly, DSL-Json shows how much can be achieved by a better faster implementation. I have to admit that this lets-generate-classes-during-compilation approach turned out to be quite seamless and performance improvements - 50% higher throughput in serialization and twice as fast during reading - are impressive.\nDSL-Json is a strong contender when external systems enforce JSON usage.\nPayload size is the smallest for Protobuf, that's reasonable given that the padding doesn't take space. The other side of spectrum is taken by textual formats, this is especially pronounced when a schema is heavily skewed towards numeric data.\nSimple binary encoding \n\nSBE requires a separate paragraph on its own. The format uses a very interesting \"zero-copy\" approach which gives the best speed results by far. This gives not only the best throughput but also the lowest latency (not measured in this particular benchmark). Zero-copy means that it tries to avoid costly encode/decode steps and reuse pre-allocated objects/buffers.\nSBE allocation graph:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nProtobuf allocations for comparison:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nProvided that we can make full use of that and don't do any unnecessary copying in the business logic (and apply a few more performance tricks) it's possible to achieve outstanding results, all on a single pinned thread.\nUnfortunately this comes at a price of usability: schema is very extensive and verbose, reading/writing requires operating on Bytes/Buffers semi-directly, and the marriage with business logic is also quite cumbersome. At least infamous XML has good tooling/IDE support out of the box. I'd say it might be a reasonable price to pay if speed is the dominant requirement and we have lots of time.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThere are other \"zero-copy\" formats like Cap'n Proto and FlatBuffers, maybe these are slightly more user-friendly. Though, it's not obvious how to make it more convenient without sacrificing performance.\nWhy benchmarking is tricky part 1: Client usage \n\nEven a single client can be used in multiple ways, this is especially acute in case of Avro where the naive usage provides speeds on par with JSON, but two relatively minor changes can give us 2.5x improvement:\n'Typical/pure' Avro serialization usage: 1132 ± 27 ops/ms\nWhen we take a look at CPU flame graph it becomes obvious what's the problem:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nIn the naive implementation we spend half the time for builders recreation on each pass. Results after introducing message builder and bytebuffer reuse:\nAvro serialization with optimizations: 2550 ± 109 ops/ms\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nMuch better. Interestingly, reusing builders in Protobuf Java implementation is counterproductive and yields similar performance results.\nThat's one of the reasons benchmarking on your own is important, even if someone achieves poor results in their application it doesn't mean that you must suffer the same fate in your system.\nWhy benchmarking is tricky part 2: Schema impact \n\nAssuming we get reasonably reliable results it's still not so easy to apply it in real world. Let's say that we use the abovementioned benchmarks to guide our choices, let's say that for our requirements Protobuf is too slow. In practice, it turns out that most or all of our data is represented by doubles, if we do the benchmark we get:\nmessage DoublesMsg {\n  double double1 = 1;           // 1.1234567899\n  double double2 = 2;           // 2.1234567899\n  double double3 = 3;           // 3.1234567899\n  double double4 = 4;           // 4.1234567899\n  double double5 = 5;           // 5.1234567899\n  repeated double doubles = 6;  // [1.132314, 2.111111, 3.314155, 4.1231488, 5.12395832]\n}\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nExplanation for enormous speed up for Protobuf, and lack of any change for JSON is probably obvious for an attentive engineer. Logic behind this is left as an exercise for the reader.\nHint, benchmarks with comparable string-only data size when serialized to JSON:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nMicro-benchmarking, is it worth it? \n\nAll problems with doing such micro-benchmarks make me wonder how much value they provide. I guess they are a good hint at what can potentially perform well, nonetheless I believe that doing a production-like end-to-end performance testing is necessary anyway - it's far too easy to make a small mistake in business logic that completely trumps any gains from faster serialization framework.\nBenchmarking, especially comparison when we aren't experts in a given technology, is hard: usually it's advised to write two versions alongside and check differences, but even in only slightly more complex scenarios writing two same versions might be a non-obvious task.\nIn the end, does it really make any difference?\nWell, for high frequency trading it can be of paramount importance when end-to-end processing time is typically measured in microseconds (even 10s of microseconds - without using FPGAs/ASICs).\nOn the other hand, if business logic takes milliseconds, or it does disk I/O, or it makes external calls, then serialization time might be on par with measurement error.\nHaving spent a few days toying with different formats and clients I settled with Protobuf. I was tempted to give SBE a try hoping that I could come up with a seamless abstraction over the client - but it doesn't seem to have good clients outside of Java and C++.\nProtobuf definitely isn't the fastest, but it seems to provide a good balance between performance and usability/time-to-market. On top of that, due to its ubiquity it's almost as easy to find performant clients in any language as it is for JSON.\nIn the future it might be useful to extend my benchmarks to measure performance per payload size, after all serialization/deserialization might not scale linearly i.e. due to implementation details.\nFootnotes \n\n\nBenchmarks codebase\nAsync profiler for performance investigation\nZero-copy formats overview by kentonv\n\n","id":"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-04-04-wire-formats/","title":"Wire formats - comparison & benchmarking"},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-06-17-software-testing/":{"body":"Testing is at the core of all complex software systems that exhibit any sense of quality - and works well for developers sanity. It's the main tool that helps us convince ourselves that what we created will probably work correctly before actually running it in production.\nThere are tons and tons of books and information out there about software testing, this falls into a slightly more specific niche that is back-end services testing, potentially in a distributed environment. It's unlikely to be of much use for GUIs, desktop software, safety critical systems, developer tools nor very large monoliths (browsers, operating systems). This can also be highly product and domain-specific.\nThis is also not going to be about the old-fashioned way of testing - manual testing, separate automated QA via selenium etc. This is about developers owning their work and striving for quality. Though on the other spectrum - this is going to be mostly about pre-production verification and its impact on future changes. This is also not going to touch continuous integration, continuous deployments, prod-pars, observability, different types of deployments and many other quality assurance techniques, although these are a vital part of a well-oiled system too.\nPreface \n\nThere is no silver bullet, no single proven solution emerged so far, additionally available tools and techniques used in creating good tests is a continuously expanding domain (albeit rather slowly). A few years ago we didn't have docker, we didn't have testcontainers, there were no good embedded solutions. We had far weaker developer machines, fewer resources at our disposal and many approaches were too time-consuming to be viable (and they are still quite a challenge for big systems).\nTreat this more like a guide than a set of concrete rules, your system might be different in ways that make it hard or even impossible to test efficiently in this manner.\nEnsuring high quality of software is a constant battle between available resources, execution time and complexity. While execution time and complexity are relatively within our reach having limited budget and time might be a showstopper. We might not be able to create multiple prod-like environments simply due to sheer costs associated with it, especially when we rely on multiple cloud services - queues, databases, warehouses, storages, 3rd party services, mainframes or even custom hardware. We might have to accept some trade-offs despite our best efforts.\nWhat's more, these costs usually don't grow linearly, getting basic testing in place is relatively cheap and gets us very far but getting a few prod-par environments and vast end-to-end tests can easily multiply our costs.\n\nTests are 'a best effort' verification of the system\n\nThis is shown from an engineering perspective, unlike in mathematics, it's about handling the trade-offs and balancing risks - given requirements we are attempting to reasonably get there, not necessarily always proving it.\nTerminology \n\nI don't think the typical test divide is of much use, everyone has their own understanding of what a 'unit' or 'integration' should mean - and it probably varies from context to context too.\nWhat I could endorse is dividing tests into two categories, mostly for convenience:\n\nFunctional tests check for functional correctness and usually answer very specific, domain oriented questions like: \n\n\nWill this request create a new user? \nWill this payment be registered and funds transferred? Will it also notify a 3rd party service?\nWill this request create a new virtual machine?\nWill this request find all user files?\n\nSuch tests are commonly known as end to end / integration tests. \nThis kind of testing makes it harder to instantly know WHY something doesn't work, that's fine, what is crucial is to know that something is broken and we don't get false positives, even if finding the root cause takes a few moments it's fine.\n\nTechnical tests - sometimes it's useful to make sure that technical constraints are also met:\n\n\nDo we correctly clean old data from this collection? Do we keep memory under given threshold?\nAre we processing a given request within acceptable time?\nCan we correctly fail-over to the secondary host? Will it preserve data?\nAre we getting to correct state after incidents or system specific events? Are we sharding correctly?\nSystems testing would fall under this category e.g., Jepsen testing\n\nDepending on technical challenges there may be very few or even no technical tests, it might turn out that having good observability can be enough.\nNote, that in a service based architecture functional tests may be served by a single service (probably most of them), or they might require half the system to be up and running, including databases and middleware.\nTo be honest, in the end this kind of tests can also easily fall under functional category, after all ability to retain data by a database is its key functionality.\nIt's useful to additionally divide tests by their running time, having two tags slow/fast is generally sufficient. This makes it easy to frequently run 'fast' tests during development and only rarely execute fully fledged slow, E2E tests.\nWhat, why, how \n\nThere is only one, singular primary goal for testing - to ensure correctness and quality, to achieve that the only way is to create simulations that can reliably imitate production environment. No rules will help us improve this part, it seems to boil down to engineer individual traits and experience. We can improve our chances by creating a process that might be conducive to quality (e.g. mandatory reviews) but in the end what matters is our (and reviewers) perception, experience and thoroughness with a pinch of paranoia.\nI believe this to be especially true for new functionality.\nSecondary goals are vital to keeping the system alive, open to change yet resistant to regressions. Tests should verify correctness for all critical functionality and at the same time they shouldn't block us from making changes to existing code. That is why old-fashioned testing where every single function is white-box tested is atrocious, add to that plenty of mocking style testing (like checking if a given method was called X times) and we get a perfect recipe for codebase that will never evolve.\nWhat we really need is fearless code modifications else we end up with a brand-new legacy system.\nThat's why the vast majority of our tests should be black-box functional tests of the API itself. What we want to know is that for a given inputs we get desired outputs or/and side effects, the fact that our system internally uses hashmaps, linked lists, 17 functions spread throughout 10 classes and stores data as a JSON blob should be of no interest to us!\nWhat we actually should do is to invoke the API itself with real, preferably resembling production data and see if the output matches our expectations:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThe inputs and outputs can be really anything, for example if the API is REST based then it's best to fire real HTTP requests and validate HTTP responses. \nThe service in the diagram above can be anything really e.g. a calculator - we provide multiple important inputs \"2+2\", \"7*12\", \"12/0\" and only validate outputs -&gt; \"HTTP 200: 4\", \"HTTP 200: 84\", \"HTTP 422: Division by 0\".\nThe time when implementation details might be important is when we need to validate side effects because we consider them the end-goal in itself - was an email sent? Was data written to disk? Sometimes it's possible to side-step it but definitely not always, or at least it's not always the reasonable approach.\nThere are only two main reasons when functional tests should be modified, when API itself changes or when the existing functionality changes - though if we expect the change to be backwards compatible it's probably better to write additional tests instead of modifying existing ones.\nChanging the API should be rare in practice when the project is out of infancy, and even then we might need to keep the old one alive in order to serve legacy clients.\nTests must be consistent and reliable. Tests that intermittently fail are just an annoying hindrance, people sooner or later stop paying attention to them letting the rot begin. Consistency is usually achieved by not relying on external, shared state and by avoiding the usual code smells like not using runtime provided dates and system clock, not using non-deterministic algorithms (like iterating over maps) etc. There are many other, better sources that describe in detail how to create consistent and reliable tests.\nExternal services, side effects and other building blocks \n\nAll the above works well and is quite easy to execute as long as our services don't require external services, or potentially persistent state to function, for example a database. \nIn such cases it's useful to leverage embedded versions if possible (e.g. Kafka provides such Java implementations) or slightly different, but mostly conforming (e.g. H2 in-mem database in tests in place of PostgreSQL that is used in production). If there are no such solutions, it might be worthwhile to create a test double (e.g. key-value store implemented as a hashmap). \nMost tests will work within a single service scope (and its direct dependencies, like middleware, databases etc.) resembling the following:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThe filesystem in this diagram can be any side effect, in this case we can assume that one of expected functionalities under test is to write some transformed data to a filesystem in some specific format. We make API calls and can create assertions directly on the filesystem itself leveraging our test infrastructure. How it's done internally by the service is inconsequential for correctness tests.\nMore complex, multi-service example, production environment:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nPotential solution when tests are run locally:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThe system must be nimble enough to work well in testing environment, databases should be easily built from scratch from scripts, state resettable and test data readily available etc. It requires more up-front work but usually is worth it in the end.\nThe problem with this approach is that our embedded versions and in-memory test doubles might behave almost like real services - but almost is not always sufficient, and sometimes it's really hard to simulate required functionality (e.g. proprietary cloud solutions).\nAt this point it's getting costly, but to alleviate such problems we can model our infrastructure as a code - including testing environment. If done well it makes it relatively easy to run all tests locally with test doubles and potentially substitute them with real implementations in our CI pipelines.\nWith the rise of containerization, and Docker in particular, it's slowly getting easier to test locally with real components instead of their mocks/doubles, this can be facilitated e.g. by Testcontainers. Testcontainers integrate JUnit based tests with Docker containers running required infrastructure - this looks promising but unfortunately is not feasible for quick testing during development. The startup time is too slow to restart the state before each test and this is a problem that I don't think can be solved anytime soon. Alternatively we could run a single instance of each component and force developers to 'clean' the state after each test on their own - personally I haven't seen much success with this approach (yet).\nThe rule of a thumb is don't use mocks (too much) unless there is no other sensible way. Use embedded versions, test doubles, sometimes custom implementations. Nonetheless, there are very legitimate situations where mocks are needed/useful, a few examples:\n\nSimulating failures\nCaching: we need to verify that the cache was actually hit to retrieve data.\nSending emails: technically we could set up a real email server and check it there, but it seems a little too excessive in my opinion.\n3rd party services that are hard to emulate in a way that provides value (especially true in DevOps/Cloud environments)\ntesting on real infrastructure, or writing good test doubles is not worth the effort\n\nIt's not enough to verify that a method on a mocked service was called, what we really want to know is if it worked - and in order to make sure that it worked we also must be sure that the expected contract with that service is fulfilled by both sides. Test environment should be a best effort simulation of production environment, the more we mock the more we lack in verisimilitude and loose confidence.\nThe testing pyramid \n\nThe most commonly met 'pyramid of automated testing' is probably the one done by Mike Cohn in Succeeding with Agile:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nThis approach might make a lot of sense when we think about convoluted monolith applications where the service/functional boundaries are hard to draw, or when pretty much everything is dependent on everything else.\nTypical unit tests are quite useful either for more technical parts (checking if collections are empty, cleaned etc.), or places where running lots of functional tests is not feasible/too costly, i.e. when we want to run hundreds of tests to test e.g. validations.\nSome people even suggest deleting such tests once verified, I'm not convinced about it, maybe we should just mark them with @Technical tag or something similar to let everyone know that this failing test doesn't necessarily indicate correctness problems and might be a natural consequence of code refactoring.\nDeveloper workstation - suitable for running the system \n\nThere is a huge jump in productivity, communication overhead and simplicity once all tests can be run on a local machine. Such tests are trivially debuggable and usually don't require shared resources - or such resources are created from scratch on-demand. This is cost, time and communication-wise far more efficient to maintaining many shared environments.\nNot to mention all the problems that we get from such environments, especially when the team grows significantly.\nIf a system is so big that it can't really fit into a single machine, we can write E2E tests in a slightly more sophisticated way. It's rare that any given functionality or flow requires the whole system to be up and running, instead we can declare which services are required for a test and run only those.\nObviously there is a theoretical limit, technically a system might be too big to fit into a single machine for testing purposes, that limit is quite far and only getting pushed further every single year.\nFor very, very large systems it might not be feasible to write a lot of system-wide functional tests, in such cases we'll most likely end up with most tests scope limited to a few/single service and only a handful of system-wide end to end tests (potentially executed on an external system, daily) - if we really deem them necessary.\nIf your company has enough resources (and is willing) to provide each developer with his own production-like environment on demand, then good for you.\nTDD, regressions \n\nEvery single regression should be covered by a test, a test written before doing any fixes. Actually, regressions are the perfect place where TDD actually yields reasonable benefits. \nOther than that and maybe maintenance type development TDD sounds like a huge pile of inefficiency, especially for newly written parts that aren't heavily coupled with existing codebase. Maybe I'm just not that great developer but implementing new software seems to be a continuous process interleaved with designing and coding. I start with rough drafts and ideas but by the end these tend to differ a lot from final implementation, even APIs evolve significantly in the process.\nCaveats / Closing words \n\nThis is already too long, yet I feel like we only scratched the surface. My original idea was way too ambitious for a single blog post, I wanted to cover things like test elegance, coverage, formal methods, prod-pars, test DSLs, configuration setup and provide actual code samples, regrettably it turned out that almost each one could be a separate post on its own. \nLastly, you can't catch all bugs, quality assurance is getting unreasonably expensive very quickly for general purpose software. Sometimes it's just better to fail fast, eat the cost and move on.\nLinks: \n\n\nPostmortem lessons by Dan Luu\nTesting v. informal reasoning by Dan Luu\nTesting microservices the sane way by Copy Construct\n\n","id":"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-06-17-software-testing/","title":"Service based systems - writing tests to ensure quality and avoid staleness"},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2022-04-22-codingame-springchallenge/":{"body":"Last week CodinGame.com hosted a Spring Challenge, it's a 10-day bot programming\ncompetition that I gave a try and wanted to share my thoughts.\nThe contest is held yearly and this time about ~8000 people participated with at least a single submission.

Except for controlling the environment itself, CodinGame checks pretty much all required\nboxes, and it works in a multiplayer mode! I intended to spend only a few hours to find out how polished the\nplatform is - to my surprise when 3 days later I clocked in ~10h+. Delight at its finest.\nThis was my first try at such type of contests so whatever you read here should be taken a with a grain of salt.\nHaving said that, let me describe the road I took to get to Gold league - it should be quite representative of what\none can expect from such events.\nWood leagues \n\nI started with the simplest tactic one can imagine: find the closest monster to my base and attack it with all we got.\nHard to get simpler... yet it turned out to be an effective approach. My take on that is that everyone\nalready moved to more efficient approaches but haven't managed to fully implement them yet.\nLet's improve it and assign a single hero to a single monster. I also noticed a pretty severe bug in my trivial implementation -\nturns out that when sides are changed (roughly half matches) own hero identifiers change i.e. 0-2 on Blue side and 3-5\non Red side. Yes, it meant that I was loosing half games instantly [cough, cough].\nThis got me into Bronze, ~TOP 2500\nBronze leagues \n\nNew league, new toys. They gave us a few spells and introduced a fog of war. Because both bases were always out of fog\nof war and my brave heroes were always going for the closed 'visible' monster... they tended to run mindlessly into\nenemy base if all monsters on my side were killed. Additionally, enemies started using spells and more sophisticated\ntactics e.g. 2 defenders and 1 attacker. The first shift of meta.\nAnother set of naive improvements - let's ignore enemies further than X distance from my base.\nThis improved my score only slightly, I jumped about 200 positions and noticed that some games end with timeout where\nplayer with higher 'wild mana' wins (wild mana - mana gathered outside own base), given that my folk usually stay within\nbase it's hard to win anything that ended due to round limit.\nBronze, TOP ~2300\nCoded basic 2-defender-1-attacker tactic, Also started using 'Control' spell on all monsters within range that are not\nheading towards enemy base and have more than 14 health points (Control spell forces a unit to move towards a given\ndirection). Ignore fog of war for now.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nSubmitted a new version, got to Bronze ~1500 and went to sleep. Got promoted to Silver overnight.\nSilver leagues and the road to Gold \n\nAbout 2000 players were moved to Silver with me, not bad. My solution was very hacky at this point, and opponents were\ngetting fancier with their solutions all the time. After fixing a few more issues with defenders (e.g. they tended to\nstick a little too close to the middle, wasting too much time on random monsters spawning next to my base). This didn't\ndo much for my overall score, top ~1300.\nI decided that it's time for a big bang rewrite as the approach is not too flexible. After another hour I was in\nslightly better shape with fewer magic ifs, functions and random numbers. Got back to working\non strategy and tactics again, this time I wanted to invest more upfront before submitting my version for evaluation.\nMajor changes:\n\nIntroduced 'stances', so that I could dynamically change behaviour e.g. DEFENDER, MIDDLE ROAM, ATTACKER, DIVE etc.\nMy 'Attacker' started farming in the middle and only around 80th turn moved into an offensive position.\nAttacker learned new tricks:\n\ne.g. Wind + Shield spell combo\nShield monsters aggressively if they are healthy and close to enemy base (so that enemies can't Wind them anymore)\n\n\nDefender improvements:\n\nuse Wind a lot more, prioritize it over everything else if monster is not shielded\nuse Control very aggressively, turned out that if I'm Controlling my side of map well enough then opponents can't\nutilize their offensive positions\n\n\n\nThis got me into top 70 (TOP 7 in Poland) and Gold league was opened on the following day!\nSeemed very promising given that I still could think of plenty improvements on both def and off sides (better combos,\nbetter farming, less reliant on magic numbers, better timing for offense, take enemy position into account when\ndefending, number of enemies, simulations, local-system parameter evaluation etc.), plus my implementation was... less\nthan ideal.\nThen I had to take a break for a few days. In fact that was my final submission.\nDay 3/4: Top 70\nOver time my AI started loosing its appeal, people caught up and even surpassed my score. Eventually, I ended the\ncompetition in top 800 a week later without any additional submissions.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nPost-mortem \n\nThis was a very interesting venture into the classic engineering loop:\nobserve -&gt; think/measure -&gt; improve -&gt; observe\nEnjoyment was absurdly high. Albeit, I felt a little disappointed when my AI got demoted into TOP 800 (out\nof ~8k participants) during my absence - I was hoping for a better final placement despite my inactivity!\nAnyway, probably still a reasonable placement for a first timer.\nIt scratched my competitive side a lot. Next time I need to set up a better schedule so that I have enough time to at \nleast give it a full try.\nA few final thoughts about the game itself:\n\nImportance of time, especially during the finish, meta changes and converges only at the end and the best\nimplementation wins, almost all people from Top 20 ended up using the same tactic.\nThe 'problem' that current meta impacts our evaluation hugely, i.e. an approach that does well right now vs currently\ndominant tactics will do bad job 3 days later when people switch.\n\nSo maybe it's not worth investing into specific tactics initially and only fine-tune it during later stages?\n\n\nTalking about meta and strategy, this went unexpectedly complex very quickly:\n\nAttacking is easier than defending, it's also easier to execute properly and yields better results quickly\nHave a funky tactic and win 70%+ games because you abuse some mechanic or try to create a more general approach\nthat, if executed well, technically, could beat everyone?\n\nWhat about CG matchmaking system? Which approach is more valued there? Win 70% vs general population vs win\n80% against top players but only 60% vs general population?\n\n\nBut that well-executed general approach would be complex - do I have enough time to do it? Is it possible during a\n10-day contest at all?\n\n\n\n","id":"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2022-04-22-codingame-springchallenge/","title":"Codingame - Spring Challenge"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.laeith.com/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-03-03-how-to-create-a-blog/":{"body":643,"title":3},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-04-04-wire-formats/":{"body":982,"title":4},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2021-06-17-software-testing/":{"body":1580,"title":9},"https://www.laeith.com/posts/2022-04-22-codingame-springchallenge/":{"body":773,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
